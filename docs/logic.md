### Lifecycle of a Ticket

```
[draft (optional)] ‚Üí created ‚Üí stored ‚Üí (read/search) 
                                    ‚Üì
                           [cancelled] or [superseded]
```

---

### Storage Model

* Tickets are **append-only**.
* Stored in **immutable logs** (DB table, JSON file, ledger).
* For regulatory compliance, tickets should be:

  * **timestamped**
  * **digitally signed** (optional, for critical logs)
  * **exportable** (PDF, CSV, XML)
